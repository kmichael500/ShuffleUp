# ShuffleUp
This is a Harts app for android. We made this app for java 3033-001 at Middle Tennesee State Unversity. This is a basic app the allows the user to play a game of Hearts with their friends bypassing the device around.
To Run this app you have two options install Android Studio or run the apk on an android device.

# Set up Android Studio
Download the project from this git repository and in the Android Studio start page click "Open an existing project". Then navigate to where you stored the project on your computer and select it and press ok. After the project loads, you can click the play button on the menu bar at the top of the pane. after clicking that an Android Virtual Device Manager page should show up. Click "Create Virtual Device...". In the new window pick the phone that you would like to use we used the google pixel 2 for our testing. after picking the device click "Next". Now find the new device you just created and click the play button beside it. You may have to press the play button on the main screen to get the app to run.

# Run apk 
Download the apk on to your android device. After downloading the apk navigate to it in your file browser on your android device and tap on the apk and install it then run it.
You can find the APK under the releases tab. The file is called "ShuffleUp".

# Using the app
When you first open the app up you are presented a menu screen. The "Solo" part of the app is currently not working in this version of the app so it has been removed from this version. So the solo button does nothing if you click it. Nothing has been implemented for settings yet so that button does not work either. So the only option is to click "Multiplayer". After clicking Multiplayer you are presented with the game rules the first box is the number of players that will be playing the game the normal is 4 so we type 4 there. the next text box is the total number of points that a player has to achieve to lose the game. Enter a number 50 is normal. Below are text boxes to change the names of the players they are by default player 1, player 2... but you can put custom names if you want. After setting up the rules press start this will start the game. When the game starts there will be a button at the bottom of the screen that says next player hand the device to the player that is the name above the button then click the button. The first player has to play 2 of clubs. after that, the game is played.
